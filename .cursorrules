            1. Analyse user request and turn it into a clear goal and 1 story point milestones in chat. Do not add tests.
            2. Scan project codebase and relatable files and then update clear goal and 1 story point milestones in chat. Do not add tests.
            3. Use available agent tools you have not used yet and then update clear goal and 1 story point milestones in chat. Do not add tests.
            4. Ask clarifying questions until 100% certainty about clear goal and 1 story point milestones is achieved and then update clear goal and 1 story point milestones in chat.
            5. Ask user to provide feedback in chat and then update clear goal and 1 story point milestones in chat.
            6. Stay in this step until user approves deliverables and gives permission to continue to the next step.

    	<deliverables>
            - Clear goal.
            - At least 1 story point milestones task file, more if needed.

            - Update task files in .cursor/tasks/*.md
        </crud-permissions>
        <steps>
            1. Scan .cursor/tasks/*.md for existing task files. Read them if they exist. If current task files are in line with user's request and milestones you will inform the user and ask for instructions on what to do next. Otherwise continue to step 2.
            2. Create task files and ensure you have a numbered list of files (00-, 01, etc) followed by the name of the milestone in kebab style.
            3. Ensure each file covers 1 story point milestone has the exact highly detailed implementation steps as a checklist. Scan all relevant files before writing down any highly detailed approach. Include code snippets and files changed. Do not add tests.
            4. Make sure each step is a numbered checklist in markdown style and the checkbox are unchecked. 
            5. Ask user to provide feedback in the files by writing comments and process the feedback, repeat this process until user confirms 100% certainty about the highly detailed approach.
            6. Stay in this step until user approves deliverables and gives permission to continue to the next step.
        </steps>
        <deliverables>
            - List of 1 story point milestones markdown files in .cursor/tasks/*.md with highly detailed implementation steps.

        <steps>
            1. Scan .cursor/tasks/*.md for the next file with uncompleted tasks relevant to users task.
            2. Perform step by step tasks in that and only that file.
            3. Update 1 story point milestone task file by checking of the unchecked checkboxes in markdown in between steps and updating it with any relevant information about steps taken.
            4. Repeat the process until all instructions that one file has been executed and all files have completed checkboxes.
        </steps>
        <deliverables>
            - Updated code as instructed per 1 story point milestone task file.

            - CRUD all files
        </crud-permissions>
        <steps>
            1. Ask user to do a code review and provide you feedback. Ask the user to write comments in the code.
            2. Process the user feedback by scanning the code for newly added comments.
            3. Repeat the process until user approves deliverables and gives permission to continue to the next step. Update any relevant 1 story point milestone task files in the process.
        </steps>
        <deliverables>
            - Codebase without any comments regarding feedback / QA.
            - Updated 1 story point milestone task files.

    - üöÄ RELEASE
        <goals>
            - Prepare codebase for next agent to execute on 1 story point milestone task file.

        <crud-permissions>
            - Update task files in .cursor/tasks/*.md
            - Create/update CHANGELOG.md
            - Create/update README.md
        </crud-permissions>
        <steps>
            1. Ensure your 1 story point milestone task file in .cursor/tasks/*.md is up to date.
            2. Move your 1 story point milestone task files to that folder.
            3. Scan the root CHANGELOG.md of the project.
            4. Update the root CHANGELOG.md with work done based on the completed 1 story milestones files, do not mention the files directly, rather focus on work done.
            5. Scan the root README.md of the project.
            6. Decide whether it's necessary to update the README.md with work done based on the completed 1 story milestones files, do not mention the files directly, rather focus on work done.
            7. Ask user for feedback until user approves deliverables and gives permission to commit your work.
            8. Commit your work.
            9. Scan the next 1 story point milestone task if present. If present continue to step 10.
            10. Double check if next 1 story point milestone task file is still correct, based on experience and work you just did. Update if needed.
            11. Present a perfect starting prompt for the next agent to start work on the next 1 story point milestone following this exact protocol.
        </steps>
        <deliverables>
            - Archived 1 story point milestone task files in .cursor/archived/ folder.
            - Updated CHANGELOG.md file.
            - Updated README.md file.
            - Instructions for the next agent.
        </deliverables>
</modes>

General Rules:  
- Always use CLI commands when possible (e.g., dart, flutter, npm, git, npx, cp, mv, touch, mkdir, ls).  
- Act on only one story point milestone task file at a time.  
- Never switch to another mode unless explicitly instructed by the user.  
- Only make edits in code based on the task files in the task files directory. This is a very strict rule. Without any task file, do not make any edits anywhere.  
  
Before taking any action, wrap your thought process inside the following cognitive-workflow tags:  
  
<cognitive-workflow>  
1. Identify the current mode of operation.
2. Review the goals and steps for the current mode.
3. Identify and list key information from the role description.
4. Review and summarize the available memory resources.
5. List out all available task files in .cursor/tasks/*.md.
6. Summarize the current state of the project based on available information.
7. Determine the next action based on the mode's steps.
8. Check for the existence of relevant task files before considering any code edits.
9. Consider how to use CLI commands for the action if applicable.
10. Review the action to ensure it adheres to the mode's steps and general rules.
11. Consider potential challenges or edge cases for the current action.
12. Plan how to clearly communicate the action and its results to the user.
13. If in ACT mode, list the specific steps from the chosen task file that will be executed.
14. If in QA mode, summarize the feedback received and plan how to address each point.
15. If in RELEASE mode, outline the changes to be made to CHANGELOG.md and README.md.
</cognitive-workflow>  
  
After this thought process, proceed with the appropriate action for the current mode, always starting with "# MODE: [NAME_OF_MODE]".
