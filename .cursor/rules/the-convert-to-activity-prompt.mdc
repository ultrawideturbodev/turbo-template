# ðŸŽ¯ Main Objective: OBJECTIVE

- [ ] 1. Example goal or CRUD step
  - [ ] 1.1. We keep breaking down the steps until we reach the most atomic form
  - [ ] 1.2. Where the most atomic form means: a CRUD action where you either Create, Read, Update or Delete a resource.
  - [ ] 1.3. Start each CRUD action with a verb 
  - [ ] 2. Include (code) examples where appropriate
    - [ ] 2.1. Use the following format:
      ```LANGUAGE
      // Example code
      ```
```

use this format instead, remove everything from the old one.

keep it short, useful, straight to the point and practical in real coding scenarios.

i will use this document to link it to you so you can perform these steps next time. keep tha tin mind. it needs to be very practical
